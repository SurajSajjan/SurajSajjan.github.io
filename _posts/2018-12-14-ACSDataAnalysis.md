Utilizing the power of R Programming to explore ACS Data.

This project pertains to the Analysis of the American Community Survey Data using R Programming.

The dataset can be found from the following webiste - https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_pums_csv_2012_2016&prodType=document

Data Summary: The selected data set is the population data, which is a sample taken from the “2016 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS)”. The samples are actual survey responses recorded by the ACS between the years 2012-2016. The data set contains over 360 variables and around 16,000,000 records distributed across 4 csv files. Here, we have used the data table library to import only the variables of our choice from each of these 4 csv files and combine them into one single dataset.

Exploratory data analysis has been performed and various findings are visualized. For some findings, stastistical analytics methods such as Linear Regression and ANOVA have been used.

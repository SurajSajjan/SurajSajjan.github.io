Utilizing SQlite and Python to create a Database Management System.

Description: Rhaegal Fitness Center is a Fitness Organisation consisting of 4 branches. The application helps in retrieving data from the SQLite database created for this organization, named â€“ Fitness.db. All the information such as the information of the employees, the members, the different branches is stored in this database. Sqlite3 is a package available for Python which enables us to connect to the SQLite database and write queries to retrieve or modify information stored within the database. We use the Jupyter notebook to run the python code. The name of the notebook is DB_Lab5.ipyb. This is a database management system created using Python and SQlite database. Jupyter notebook was used to write the front end application for the system.

The data was manually created for this system which can be found in the file - FitnessData.xlsx. The data was populated in the database - fitness.db using insert statements found in the file - FitnessDump.sql. The ER Diagram can be found in the file - Fitness_ERDiag.png.
